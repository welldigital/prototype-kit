# Well Digital prototype kit

The prototype kit provides a simple way to make interactive prototypes that look like pages on well.co.uk. These prototypes can be used to show ideas to people you work with, and to do user research.

## Installation

You will need to install:

- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - version 6.x.x

If you have node.js installed and access to the command-line, you can now run the following command:

```javascript
npm install 
```

## Credit

We are standing on the shoulders of our friends at The [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service) by extending the [gov.uk prototype kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/about) which they have developed over a number of years.

They have done the hard work to make it simple, at Well Digital we share their belief that [making things open, makes them better](https://www.gov.uk/design-principles#tenth). We intend to contribute back to the GOV.UK Prototype Kit as we use it here at [Well Digital](http://digital.well.co.uk).
