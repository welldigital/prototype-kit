# Well Digital Prototype Kit

The prototype kit provides a simple way to make interactive prototypes that look like pages on well.co.uk. These prototypes can be used to show ideas to people you work with, and to do user research.

We are standing on the shoulders of our friends at The [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service) by extending the [gov.uk prototype kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/about) which they have developed over a number of years.

They have done the hard work to make it simple, at Well Digital we share their belief that [making things open, makes them better](https://www.gov.uk/design-principles#tenth). We intend to contribute back to the GOV.UK Prototype Kit as we use it here at [Well Digital](http://digital.well.co.uk).
